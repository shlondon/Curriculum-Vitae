### Professional profile

I am an economist oriented to research and data analysis. I have
developed research on issues related to entrepreneurship and the
informal economy and have developed data products (software) associated
with teaching inferential statistics concepts and researching the gender
gap in entrepreneurship. I considered fundamental data analysis to
design strategies in both the private and public sectors, and no less
important for the proper development of scientific research, for that
reason I am doing the Data Science specialization in Coursera, where I
am improving my skills in Econometrics and statistics (inferential,
multivariate, machine learning: supervised algorithms and unsupervised
algorithms) and in the use of the famous software for data analysis,
known as R. In this way, my academic and professional interest is in the
participation of academic projects, consulting projects, private or
public interdisciplinary projects that contain a high component of data
analysis for decision making or the support of scientific arguments.

Life is wonderful, it has given me an incomparable family, an
unparalleled companion and an enviable fortune for even the most
fortunate of men. I dream of becoming a data scientist and a great
communicator. I hope to continue to value small things, which in my
opinion are not small, because having the ability to walk, see, smell,
hug, decide and love make me the strongest of all superheroes. I do not
want money and fame, only time to build my life, doing what I like and
accompanied by those who love me.
